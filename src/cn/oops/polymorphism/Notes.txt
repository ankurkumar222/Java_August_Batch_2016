
Polymorphism in Java
--------------------

Two types of polymorphism in java: 
	compile time polymorphism 
	runtime polymorphism.

	compile time polymorphism
	-------------------------
		We can perform polymorphism in java by method overloading and method overriding.
		If you overload static method in java, it is the example of compile time polymorphism. 
	
	
	Runtime Polymorphism in Java
	-----------------------------
		Runtime polymorphism is a process in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime rather than compile-time.
		In this process, an overridden method is called through the reference variable of a superclass. 
		The determination of the method to be called is based on the object being referred to by the reference variable.
